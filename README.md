# SCons Tempalate #

This is meant as a simple repository for me to write a set of SCons
modules I can reuse from project to project, CMake style. Mostly because
I am sick of CMake's incredibly crufty language.

Right now there is just a proof-of-concept module for boost on
Linux. I intend to add a number of libraries that I use personally as
I go along, and generalise the module loading a bit. It is my hope it becomes
a useful reusable resource for many SCons based project and pusuades people
who otherwise might have gone the CMake route to give SCons a try.
